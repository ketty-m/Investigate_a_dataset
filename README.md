## by (Ketty Muwowo)


## Dataset

The data set we have selected for analysis is the No-show appointments data set. This data set is a collection of the medical appointments from Brazil in the year 2016. Our main focus is to determine whether or not patients show up for appointments and find out what factors are important to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for appointment or not. The dataset consists of 
14 columns which tells us about the characteristics of the patients. Some of which include the following

Scheduled day : this informs us on what day the patients set up their appointment.
Neighborhood : specifies the location of the hospital
Scholarship : tells as whether or not a particular patient is enrolled in the Brasillian welfare program Bolsa Familia.
No-show : which indicates 'No' if the patient showed up to their appointments and 'Yes' if they did not show up.
SMS_receved : This tells us whether the patient received an sms notification reminding them about the appointment.
Gender : Whether the patient is male or female.
Age : Tells us the age of the patient.



## Summary of Findings

Upon undertaking the exploratory data analysis, it was observed that females are more likely to miss appointments than males though with a small margin.
It was also observed that patients who have no scholarships are not likely to miss appointments as compared to those who have. 
We further observed that the majority of no show appointments were common in children and aldults as opposed to the eldery. 
In conclusion, we also observed that the majority of patients that recieved Sms did not show up for appointments.
